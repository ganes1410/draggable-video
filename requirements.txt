- Create a video element (with any mp4/mov video) of size: 200:300px (width:height) and
place it at the bottom left of the screen.
- You should be able to drag and drop the element at any corner of the screen. Consider
the screen to be of 4 quarters and when you drop the element at any quarter, it
should get placed at the corner of that quarter.

Requirements:

2. Write your own logic to handle Drag and Drop events
3. The video element should be in the pause state by default.
4. On click/touch of the video element, the video should play or pause.
5. On dragging, the video should move but go to a paused state irrespective of
the current state(playing or pause) of the video.
6. You need to test it on a mobile device as well (not just on the desktop
browser)
Optional:
6. The transition after you release the video should be smooth.
7. Style the video container such that it stands out from the body.
